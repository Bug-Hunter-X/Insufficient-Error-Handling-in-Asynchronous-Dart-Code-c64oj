# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations. The provided `bug.dart` file showcases code that fetches data from a remote API but lacks robust error management.  The `bugSolution.dart` offers an improved version with enhanced error handling.

## Bug Description:

The original code only prints a generic error message and rethrows the exception.  This doesn't provide enough information for debugging or user feedback. 

## Solution:

The solution includes more specific error handling, allowing the application to react to various HTTP status codes and exception types, offering a better user experience and improving debugging capabilities.
